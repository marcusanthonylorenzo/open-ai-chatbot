#### :warning: **Please make sure** that in order to run the project correctly:

##### 	:exclamation: You will need an API key :old_key: for this project to work. Please retrieve one [HERE]().
- Please keep your new key on hand for instructions.
- In the instructions below, we will store and .gitignore your key in a `.env` file and in your code it will be assigned to `process.env.API_KEY`.

##### 	:exclamation: Once you've received this repo on your computer:
- Install the node_modules directory (node: `npm install` or yarn: `yarn install`).
- Install package to load environment variables from .env with `npm install dotenv-webpack@2.0.0 --save-dev`.
- Bundle the code, and run the program via server. (node: `npm run start` or yarn: `yarn run start`).
